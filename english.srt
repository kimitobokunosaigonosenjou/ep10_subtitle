1
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,450
Please say the access code.

2
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:30,120
Above heaven, below heaven,
the only treasure is the Emperor.

3
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,160
The Successor of the Black Steel has returned.
Also, in regard to Salinger--

4
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,410
Let's skip that. Anyway, the Eight Great
Apostles really are troublesome, huh?

5
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,620
Are they still trying to capture a purebred?

6
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,540
You can stop them if you say the word.

7
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,040
It's not even worth my time.

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:07,040
Something very exciting is happening.
This is the first in 100 years.

9
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,490
Founder Nebulis... Finally,
one of your bloodlines has fallen...

10
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,370
A witch princess has fallen in love
with an Imperial swordsman.

11
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:01,160
Your Majesty, I hope you are doing very well.

12
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:07,200
Ah, Princess Sisbell. It is an honor
to be in your presence.

13
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,660
Milady, Her Majesty is asking for you.

14
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,870
Mother is?

15
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:38,040
Third Princess Sisbell, I am giving you
an order to head to Alsamira.

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,580
Unlike Ein, Alsamira is an independent
nation that hasn't declared neutrality.

17
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:48,910
We have intel that Alsamira is fostering
a relationship with the Empire.

18
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:56,330
I need you and your astral spirit to
find out if they'll side with the Empire.

19
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,330
I understand.

20
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:03,330
Sisbell, would you like to take
my guards for this quest?

21
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:08,490
I will be fine. Please keep
your guards by your side.

22
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:25,330
Your Majesty, First Princess
Elletear has returned.

23
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,910
I see.

24
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:49,080
Iska! They didn't find anything
wrong in your physical, did they?

25
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:55,160
All clear. Though they kept asking
if I was tortured or interrogated.

26
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,830
Everyone else?

27
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,540
We need to go back in a week.

28
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:06,580
They want to make sure the artificial
astral crests stamped on us will disappear.

29
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:15,040
She's trying to escape reality,
since her astral crest isn't going anywhere.

30
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,790
Re-examination is a problem.

31
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:23,830
Risya, this is illegal. I'll be reporting this
to the Imperial Senate.

32
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:29,620
Oww... Come on, I said I was sorry, Mikki.

33
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,540
Risya, what's wrong?

34
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:34,080
Uh, well, you know...

35
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:42,660
Hello, Unit N07. I'm Michaela from
HQ's medical coordination team.

36
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,660
N-Nice to meet you!
So, um, is something wrong?

37
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,330
Something is very wrong.
I have reviewed your work hours.

38
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:00,580
Everyone is working too much.

39
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:05,950
Military law limits consecutive combat
allowed for Third Division to 30 days.

40
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,540
We extend that to 45 days
for special ops, but...

41
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,830
Basically, you are all working way too hard.

42
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:17,040
Huh?

43
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,040
Under somebody's irresponsible command,

44
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,580
you were ordered to engage
the Ice Calamity Witch

45
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,830
and perform other risky missions.
Three units would've been KIA by now.

46
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:31,200
HQ's decision would be under scrutiny
if the public ever found out.

47
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,580
It's fine. We just have to not get caught.

48
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,620
It is so not fine!

49
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,990
What does this all mean, exactly?

50
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:44,160
We're ordering you to take leave.
You are not allowed to work for 60 days.

51
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
Sixty days?!

52
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:51,790
That is all. Now, let's get back to work, Risya.

53
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,370
Well, bye, everyone. Enjoy your vacay.

54
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,120
I wish I could have a vacation...

55
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:10,330
Forced leave?! Does that mean the astral
crest check-up is postponed, too?!

56
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,950
It isn't what it sounds like.

57
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,240
Huh?

58
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,660
Any normal unit may have been KIA
on each of the three missions we went on.

59
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,290
They're only giving us 60 days
of leave to call it even.

60
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:27,540
Well, when you put it like that...

61
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,370
But we're not in hot water anymore.

62
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,080
We have more time to deal
with Boss' astral crest.

63
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:38,540
If we're careless about finding a solution,
they'll catch on. Should we leave?

64
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:44,240
I'm on board! It'll look natural
to go away on a vacation.

65
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,700
Someplace far away from the Empire,
like a resort, will be great!

66
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,330
Phew, I'm all done.

67
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:06,160
That was from two weeks ago.
This is last week's and this week's work.

68
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:13,490
No! I can't do this! Look, Rin!
I have callus from writing so much!

69
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:16,490
You could use your other hand.

70
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:17,910
Is this torture?!

71
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,540
I'm only kidding. Shall we take a break?

72
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:33,620
This whole day, I've been in the study
helping Mother's administrative work.

73
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,540
It's so monotonous and makes me sleepy.
I need excitement.

74
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:43,490
If by excitement you mean thrill,
you had enough of that a few days ago.

75
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
Lady Alice.

76
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,870
N-No! I wasn't remembering that day...

77
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:55,620
Here's your milk tea.

78
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:01,330
I've added more sugar than usual,
so please stir well before drinking.

79
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:03,370
Th-Thanks.

80
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:21,580
A fanfare of someone's return.

81
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,830
Maybe for my older sister, Elletear?

82
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:32,160
Back so quickly? Her campaign to woo
the voters must be going so well.

83
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:33,910
Rin.

84
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,910
Shall we welcome her return?

85
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:38,830
We should.

86
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,580
Sisbell?

87
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,990
Are you going to go see Sis? Let's go toget--

88
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:55,910
Excuse me.

89
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:02,160
She's like a different person these days.

90
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:08,080
She used to be as energetic
and curious as you, Lady Alice.

91
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,870
I don't blame her.

92
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:16,740
With the ministers discussing who'll be
the next queen, things are awkward.

93
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,790
I feel it, too. I'd rather just
leave the palace.

94
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,330
You cannot.

95
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:22,700
Why not?

96
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,790
Right now, powerful astral mages are
concentrated in the Central providence.

97
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:31,080
In preparation for the Empire's invasion,

98
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,450
Her Majesty is considering allocating
that power throughout the Sovereignty.

99
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:40,410
That's right. So why shouldn't I leave, then?

100
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:43,580
Well, it appears Lady Sisbell
is leaving instead.

101
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,540
She's headed to the independent nation
in the East under Her Majesty's orders.

102
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,740
She is?

103
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,410
Therefore, you must stay.

104
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,490
Ugh... fine.

105
00:09:57,830 --> 00:10:00,540
I need more excitement...

106
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,740
Let us go.

107
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,450
Are you positive about just having me
as your guard for this trip to Alsamira?

108
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:26,870
Schwartz, you should know better.

109
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,450
Have you heard the rumors?

110
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:39,080
Yes, the Second Princess, Aliceliese,
is a strong candidate for the election.

111
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:42,910
We must make our decision soon.

112
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:45,950
The palace is full of people like them.

113
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:49,870
I will not be putting my trust
in anyone but you.

114
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,540
That nightmare will come true.
Someone is coming after Mother.

115
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,910
There's a monster trying
to take over this nation.

116
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:07,040
Be brave, Sisbell.
You're the only one who knows of this!

117
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,290
Milady?

118
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:12,830
It's nothing. Let's go, Schwartz.

119
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:18,700
Mother, I promise I will protect you.

120
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:23,040
So please be safe while I'm away.

121
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,540
Seems Sisbell has left.

122
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,410
I haven't spoken to her for quite some time.

123
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:41,330
Between the three sisters,
you're the only one that always visits us.

124
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,740
Am I welcomed?

125
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,700
Of course you are...

126
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,660
...Elletear.

127
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,700
It's been a while, Elletear.

128
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,950
I'm delighted the eldest daughter of Lou

129
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:01,580
would take the time to visit me,
a Zoa, so shortly after her return.

130
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:06,990
Please don't say such a thing.
Lou or Zoa, it shouldn't matter.

131
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,870
Especially during a time like this...

132
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,830
Is something the matter?

133
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,910
It would shake this nation to the core.

134
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,700
Oh?

135
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:23,990
Someone close to us is involved with the
Empire behind the scenes. Did you know?

136
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:29,450
What an interesting thing to say.
Do you have solid proof?

137
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:33,700
I don't think they have become
pawns of the Empire yet.

138
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,290
But I cannot let this go on...
I'm at a loss as to what to do...

139
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,790
An intelligent woman like you?

140
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,540
Tell me, who is this person you speak of?

141
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,370
Independent nation, Alsamira.

142
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:10,700
They may or may not be secretly
considering becoming the Empire's ally.

143
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,080
Sure, but that's just a rumor.

144
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,290
Of course it is. They're making bank
with these resorts.

145
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:24,870
It's so hot! This isn't mid-summer hot
but pan-frying hot!

146
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,040
This is amazing! It really is a tropical resort!

147
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,620
Looks like they plan on having a blast.

148
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:36,490
Well, Captain's safe outside the Empire.

149
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:41,950
We need to figure out how to hide
her astral crest while we're here.

150
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:45,870
Here, Iska. Inflate these for us.

151
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:50,240
It's too soon! We just walked off of the bus.

152
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:55,120
Look! Marine Hotel, Hotel Isberia,
and the Grand Illumination Group Hotel!

153
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:01,450
They're all super famous hotels!
This is like a dream! Let's go!

154
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:03,540
Hold on, Captain!

155
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,450
Well...

156
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,200
Just for today.

157
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:16,990
Wow...

158
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:19,370
Sorry for the wait!

159
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:23,040
It took me a while to blow up my swim tubes.

160
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
What do you think, Iska?

161
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,830
What about my bathing suit? Is it cute?

162
00:14:28,830 --> 00:14:30,790
Y-Yes.

163
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:39,790
OK, let's do a 100m swim race! Let's go!

164
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:41,650
Come on, hurry up!

165
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:43,740
You can't even swim that long, Boss.

166
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:58,540
The wind's getting colder.

167
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:02,910
Night in the desert gets chilly.
I wonder if Captain's okay?

168
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:08,910
The beer finished her off.
She rarely drinks at all.

169
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:12,490
Jhin, could you take Captain to the hotel?

170
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:15,740
We'll go get dinner from the supermarket.

171
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,410
Don't get lost.

172
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:26,240
Iska, can you wait here?
I drank a lot of juice and need to go...

173
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,450
Okay.

174
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,990
I'll be back!

175
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,330
Oh, are you okay?

176
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:45,370
Ouch... E-Excuse me. I've gotten lost
and was looking at the map.

177
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,330
You're...

178
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:53,660
Huh?

179
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:59,200
You're... That girl...

180
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,200
U-Um!

181
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,040
Thanks for waiting, Iska!

182
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,450
Huh? What is it?

183
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,290
N-Nothing!

184
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:13,410
Oh, I know! She was just
asking for directions, and...

185
00:16:13,410 --> 00:16:14,660
Who was?

186
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,660
Huh?

187
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,700
Iska?

188
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:26,990
Never mind. Anyway, we should
head to the supermarket. Let's go.

189
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:35,990
Is this even possible?!

190
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:45,540
He's here! Saint Disciple Iska is here!

191
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,790
Milady!

192
00:16:48,950 --> 00:16:54,160
I was looking for you.
Please be more kind to this old body.

193
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,370
I found him!

194
00:16:55,370 --> 00:16:56,330
Hmm?

195
00:16:56,330 --> 00:17:02,700
Listen, Schwartz! I finally found
my dream knight that I was looking for!

196
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,370
I need to talk to you immediately.
Let's head back to the hotel first.

197
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,700
What is going on?

198
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:12,290
We'll wait for nighttime.

199
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:18,040
I'm utterly exhausted.

200
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:23,330
You worked hard. There's a meet and greet
at 5 AM tomorrow in the Queen's Hall.

201
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:26,950
Twenty people including guests from
foreign nations and ministers will be there.

202
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,540
Please be prepared to
greet everyone individually.

203
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:32,620
Have you no heart?!

204
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,870
Alice.

205
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,540
M-Mother?! Rin, quickly, get the door!

206
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:39,450
O-Of course!

207
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:47,120
Mother, is something wrong?

208
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,950
Please come with me.

209
00:17:49,950 --> 00:17:51,200
What?

210
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:05,040
There aren't many people out in this cold.

211
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:10,620
Keep your guard up and be
on the lookout, Schwartz.

212
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:14,410
Stars, show me your past.

213
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,620
Iska?

214
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:24,830
Never mind. Anyway, we should head
to the supermarket. Let's go.

215
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:31,450
Milady, are you really
going to ask for his help?

216
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,990
Yes. Let's go.

217
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,160
Mother, where are we going?

218
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:43,410
Is that the key to Lady Sisbell's room?

219
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:47,990
Yes. She's traveling, so she
left the key with me.

220
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:59,080
Alice, what do you think of her recently?

221
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,120
Huh?

222
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:06,200
As a queen, I wish for you two to be
as graceful as royal members should be.

223
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,370
However, I am also your mother.

224
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:13,660
Right now, the retainers do not
have much faith in Sisbell.

225
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:19,580
It will be difficult for her to win
the election, but that cannot be helped.

226
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:24,950
But as a mother, I have the
responsibility to raise her well.

227
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:29,950
Your Majesty, did you send
Lady Sisbell out because...

228
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:33,620
No, that was because she was
best suited for the job.

229
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,790
But this is a good opportunity.

230
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:43,870
I'm worried about Sisbell. What is she doing
cooped up in her room every day?

231
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,540
It's only natural for a parent
to want to know these things.

232
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:52,700
We will join you, Mother.

233
00:19:57,160 --> 00:20:00,120
It's one of the hotels Jarmrick Company owns.

234
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,040
It's an established hotel
that rates slightly above average.

235
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,330
Perfect for an Imperial soldier
to stay for his vacation?

236
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:12,410
Yes. If they're here on
a secret op from the Empire,

237
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:18,040
they'd stay at a better hotel or
one in affiliation with the Empire.

238
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:21,540
Even better. We'll proceed as planned.

239
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,620
Of course.

240
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,410
Let's split up and look around.
Alice, Rin, you two work together.

241
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,490
Yes, Mother.

242
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,580
Er, um...

243
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,870
An assassin?

244
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:26,040
I never thought I'd snoop around
my little sister's room...

245
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,120
Who do you work for? The Sovereignty?

246
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,370
N-No, this is a misunderstanding!

247
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,330
You're...

248
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:53,830
I came to see you.

249
00:21:54,830 --> 00:22:00,370
How... How does Sisbell know Iska?

250
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,740
Saint Disciple Iska, there's something
I would like to ask you.

251
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,120
Ask me?

252
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:13,910
Would you accompany me to the Sovereignty?

253
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:19,950
